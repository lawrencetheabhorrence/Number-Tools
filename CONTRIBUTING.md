# Contributing
Code style is enforced with ESLint which comes with the React app. Add contributions to the "number-tools" folder, the folders outside it are just the old project which will soon be reworked in React.

## Things that I might need help for
Right now, it's just implementing the methods for tool_methods, documentation, and writing tests for the methods in the meanwhile.
